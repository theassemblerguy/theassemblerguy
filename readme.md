# Hey there!

Thanks for checking me out! I'm a blind hobby programmer/hacker who likes to code directly in assembler, for the sake of squeezing the very last possible bit of performance out of everything. Please don't expect much here, though. I've created this account primarily to be able to help the Miranda NG project. My intention is to either write a fully-featured Telegram plugin that will support not only private and group messaging, but also voice messaging, as well as both private and group voice calls, or I will implement calling for Discord. It depends on what is easier, especially in regard to how the banning issue is going to develop on the latter platform.

# Languages I've been working with
-	Assembler languages for ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC
-	C
-	C++
-	Java
-	JavaScript (not too proud of that one)
-	Python
# But most importantly
The x86 assembler languages (especially MASM style)
However, I have my very own, heavily modified assembler in the meantime actually.

# Other skills
-	Profound expertise in the WinAPI and the NT-Kernel
-	Advanced knowledge about the component object model (COM)
-	Highly skilled at reverse-engineering and hacking in general
-	Ability to work both in teams (size doesn't matter) and alone

# Hobbies and interests
Skiing, playing drums, swimming, dancing, programming, and spending time with my family.
